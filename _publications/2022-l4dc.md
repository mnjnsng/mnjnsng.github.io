## Abstract

We present $\mathcal{L}_1$ - MBRL , a control-theoretic add-on scheme for model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms. Model based RL algorithms differ from model-free approaches in that they use data to learn a model of the transition dynamics, using which a control input is designed. Our add-on scheme utilizes the transition dynamics model to design a control input augmentation which perturbs the input produced by the MBRL algorithm. The add-on scheme relies on $\mathcal{L}_1$ - adaptive control to perturb the MBRL input to counter the effects due to epistemic uncertainties in the learned model of the transition dynamics. Epistemic uncertainties are always present due to a lack of sufficient data available to the high-level MBRL algorithms. Thus, we design the add-on scheme to make the MBRL algorithm robust to (unlearned) uncertainties in the transition dynamics. Notably, the add-on scheme does not put any additional requirements on the high-level MBRL. Therefore, the MBRL algorithm can operate as it is designed to and is entirely agnostic to the presence of the add-on scheme. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology using numerical simulations on several platforms common for testing RL algorithms. Furthermore, since our add-on scheme utilizes $\mathcal{L}_1$ -adaptive control, a robust adaptive control methodology, we also observe superior performance and sample efficiency in the presence of observation and action noise which most real systems are subject to.
