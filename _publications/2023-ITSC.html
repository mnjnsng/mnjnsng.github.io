<h2>Abstract</h2>

We present an end-to-end air traffic management framework for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operations that is both
scalable and robust. Our approach involves defining congestion in the airspace and developing a congestion-based cost
map that can mitigate potential congestion while adhering to regulations and guidelines. Each UAS operation leverages a
recursively updated cost map in solving the path planning problem, providing scalability of the framework. Additionally,
we introduce a time-critical controller to enhance the robustness of mission execution. Empirical evidence confirms the
feasibility and effectiveness of our method, achieving significant reductions in both cumulative and maximum levels of
airspace congestion.

<h2>Results</h2>

Congestion induced with and without RFTT was compared, and an additional limit on its travel distance per time interval
was not imposed. This process involves creating a 3D model of the city by comparing off-nadir satellite imagery, and
then using edge detection to separate buildings from the terrain in vertical satellite images. Resulting terrain,
roadway, and building models are projected vertically into polygons and color-coded based on their respective zoning to
generate an airspace capacity map. Using the constructed airspace capacity, we created a congestion map. The paths taken
by each UAS were visualized in the following figure.

For a more realistic scenario, we obtained a satellite image of a portion of the city of San Carlos, California, and
processed it to create a congestion map

environment.
